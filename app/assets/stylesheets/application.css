 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,

 *      require jquery-ui
 *      require ../../../vendor/assets/stylesheets/sweetalert.css
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the
 * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
